# Scottish Power Tech Test

The application is built using Micronaut 3.9.3 and uses h2 as an in-memory database. The service has two dummy methods for inserting users and readings, as well as two methods for retrieving user information via their account number and a reading item via the same variable.

Micronaut was chosen for the application due to its lower memory usage to Spring Boot and faster time to start. It is also cloud native and is supported to run on Serverless platforms such as Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.
